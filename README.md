# Machine Learning and PDEs to predict rainfall
Work done at the FORMES research group under Dr. Yves Atchade at Boston University.

TODOs:
- Implement ocean SST PDE in Python PDE solver (eg. py-pde)
- Generate simulation data from PDE solver
- Implement U-Net model in PyTorch
- Implement warping scheme
- Use U-Net to predict future state of SST PDE
